Static website for a study group for John Kruschke's Doing Bayesian Data analysis, 2nd edition

## Build
The site is static, and hosted on Github Pages. The content for the pages can be found in the `content` folder. Once [Github Pages are set up](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/), building the website should be as simple as

    make github
