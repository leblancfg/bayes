We are a group of motivated Canadian Public Servants who want to get our feet wet with Bayesian analysis and probabilistic programming. 
This website will serve as an easily-accesible repository of course material, syllabus, references, etc.

## Bayesian Statistics
Here's a short-ish explanatory video of Bayesian analysis:

Bayesian analysis is particularly useful when:

* You have prior beliefs about unknown model parameters or explicit information about data generation &mdash; i.e., useful info you want to incorporate
* You have few data or many unknown model parameters and it is hard to get an accurate result with your data alone (without the added structure or information)
* You want to capture the uncertainty about your result &mdash; how sure or unsure your model is &mdash; instead of only a single “best” result

## Course Plan

>[Tentative syllabus](pages/syllabus.html)

Based on multiple suggestions, we'll be following John Krushke's Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan (2nd edition) book.

This study group will meet weekly, and consist of two parts:

1. **Reading the chapters individually** before each session, and
2. **Meeting for 1h every week** to go through exercises together.

We might lump some a few of the introductory chapters for the first weeks. We'll end up using both Python and R.

## Logistics

The plan is to webcam over WebEx, and perform directed sessions together as a study group. Suggestions for other means of doing this are more than welcome. Depending on interest, we can look into booking rooms.
